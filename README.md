MindStage VR: A Web-Based Exposure Therapy Tool
MindStage VR is an immersive, web-based virtual reality prototype designed to help individuals overcome glossophobia (the fear of public speaking) through controlled exposure therapy. This application provides a safe, adaptive environment where users can practice public speaking, manage anxiety, and build confidence.

üéØ About The Project
This project was built to address the challenges faced by individuals with anxiety disorders, phobias, and PTSD, who often lack access to safe and controlled therapeutic environments. Traditional methods can be inaccessible or stigmatizing.

MindStage VR tackles this by simulating an anxiety-inducing scenario‚Äîpublic speaking‚Äîin a way that is:

Safe: The user is in complete control of the experience.

Accessible: It runs on any modern web browser, on desktop or mobile.

Personalized: The difficulty adapts to the user's comfort level.

The core of the application is a bio-feedback loop that doesn't require any physical sensors. The user self-reports their anxiety, and the application responds with a guided therapeutic intervention, creating a complete and effective training tool.

‚ú® Key Features
** immersive VR Environment:** A realistic 360¬∞ environment places the user on a stage in front of an audience, viewable in full VR on mobile devices.

Adaptive Difficulty: The simulation starts with a small, unintimidating audience. After successfully managing their anxiety, the user can choose to advance to a larger, more challenging crowd.

Interactive Bio-Feedback: Users can click a button to signal rising anxiety. After a set threshold, the app initiates a guided deep-breathing exercise with visual cues to help them calm down.

Real-time Progress Tracking: An on-screen display shows the user's current anxiety level, providing immediate feedback on their state.

Realistic Details: The scene includes directional lighting, shadows, and subtle animations to enhance the sense of presence and immersion.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
This prototype was built using a stack of free, accessible, and powerful web technologies, making it easy to develop and share.

A-Frame: An open-source web framework for building virtual reality experiences with HTML.

JavaScript (ES6): For all interactivity, state management, and therapeutic logic.

HTML5 & CSS3: For the structure and basic styling of the application.

Replit: For in-browser development and instant hosting.

üéÆ How to Use
Launch the Demo: Open the live demo link above.

Report Anxiety: If you feel anxious, click the red "I feel anxious" button. The on-screen counter will increase.

Use the Calming Tool: After three clicks, the simulation will pause and a guided breathing exercise will begin. Follow the on-screen visual cues.

Advance to the Next Level: Once the exercise is complete, a blue "Next Level" button will appear. Click it to face a larger audience.

Go Back: If the hard level is too much, a yellow "Go Back" button will appear, allowing you to return to the smaller audience.

Enter VR Mode (Mobile): On a smartphone, tap the goggles icon in the bottom-right corner to enter the split-screen VR view for use with a headset.
